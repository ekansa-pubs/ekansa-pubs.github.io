        <p>This represents a first attempt to make sense of what is happening, from the perspective of a digital archaeologist and open access advocate. Beware! It is my first pass at trying to come to grips with a new reality. It will be somewhat rambling as I haven't fully integrated my thoughts into anything close to coherence.</p>

        <p>Donald J. Trump is now President-elect, even though he lost the popular vote. This is a legal and constitutional reality likey to be ratified by the Electoral College. But that should comfort nobody. Just to remind everyone, in 2012 when Trump thought that Romney won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College he used Twitter to call for a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/11/10/trump-warms-electoral-college-4-years-calling-disaster-democracy/" target="_blank">"revolution" against Obama</a>.</p>

        <p>He deleted those <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13596932/trump-protestors-electoral-college-tweets" target="_blank">now awkward revolutionary tweets</a>. So you can't see them for yourself, and you have to trust third parties that archived the tweets. I suspect this kind of thing is now going to be the norm.</p>

        <p>Erasing digital history is a big deal to those of working to safeguard our society's digital and cultural memory. The purpose of digitally preserving and sharing knowledge has much to own the scientific and intellectual revolution of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" target="_blank">Enlightenment</a>. Ideals of the Enlightment shaped the US Constitution, and the constitutional protections for free speech and thought make learning and discovery possible. However, faith in Enlightenment ideals of reason, rationality, and truth (as challenging as these ideals are in practice), completely failed during this election. Lies and anger beat evidence and reason. As media-guru Clay Shirky noted, (the democrats) "<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160812014327/https://www.currentaffairs.org/2016/07/democrats-need-to-stop-insisting-that-everything-is-going-well" target="_blank">brought fact checkers to a Culture War</a>". I'll get to some of those implications in a later essay, especially all the institutional failures that got us here, but first I want to talk about the immediate emergency.</p>

        <h3>Comforting Lies</h3>
        <p>There's no getting away from this. There's been some talk of how "urban elites" need to better understand the people and problems of "fly-over" country. I'm sure that's the case. As a humanist / social scientist I'm in the business of "better understanding" after all. We have friends, family, and colleagues in fly-over country and our work often takes us all over the US. I think the reasons for Trump's success in "Red America" versus his failures in urban America are complex and probably do not boil down simply to economic anxiety. After all, economic anxiety is pretty commonplace. My colleauges and I also face long working hours, the stresses and precariousness of uncertain and cut-throat grant funding, and relentless performance pressures that we routinely face working at the margins of a broken academic system. And yet, the only Trump voters I know are in my family, not my circle of friends or colleagues. So why?</p>

        <p>It seems to me that much of this stems from people not wanting to leave what one might call a “comfort zone”. Everyone has a different comfort zone, which is largely defined by life experiences-- who you know, where you go, where you live. Leaving one's comfort zone can be hard, it also requires practice as a life skill. But in order to avoid discomfort, we often make excuses. By-and-large Trump voters are not fascists, I hope they'd feel at least some quiet dismay at the sight of committed fascists now embolded by Trump's rise. In general, I think most Trump voters just don't want their comfort zone disrupted. Sadly, it seems to me that Trump voters, in a that desire to maintain their their comfort zone, and go about their lives, have swallowed a large dose of willful denial of reality. It is hard to see and grasp structural racism or police brutality. It's a lot easier to dismiss these issues as "whining". It is hard to acknowledge the reality of Climate Change and the hard questions it raises about so much of the world order. Similarly, "Hollywood" and "the Liberal Media" which all occasionally manage to raise questions about gender, race and other issues can be resented for intruding into the comfort zone. And finally, there is immigration. Immigration threatens one's comfort zone, since it brings one face to face with difference and the unknown. Trump, a habitual liar, spectacularly exploited this willful and pervasive rejection of uncomfortable realities.</p>

        <p>In the research community, we also try not to break our comfort zones. We can also lack much self-awareness of our own ethical blind-spots. As I've argued for years, many academic institutions, typically associated with the Left, can be <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/01/27/its-the-neoliberalism-stupid-kansa/" target="_blank">terribly dehumanizing and exploitative</a>. But a worse sin is insularity. We tend to talk among ourselves (our comfort zone), often avoiding confrontation or even dialog. You know those awkward moments with family when topics like religion and politics come up? How many missed opportunities did we have for respectful but fearless dialog?</p>

        <h3>Now What?</h3>
        <p>I invested my heart and soul in this past election, first supporting Bernie Sanders out of great enthusiasm (and money). I work at the margins of a dysfuntional academic system, and Hilary Clinton reminded me of a university Dean or Chancelor: very smart, highly competent and accomplished, and tough, but invested in a system I found dehumanizing. Even though the idea of wrecking a bad system sounds superficially appealing, one has to have a humane system ready to protect the vulnerable from the aftermath. So after Sanders lost, I then supported Hillary Clinton out of great fear (and more money). Anyone who followed me on Twitter will remember my periodic panic attacks starting in July 2016 when I realized Trump could win. They will also remember my worries about the polls and the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Black_Swan_(Taleb_book)" target="_blank">Black Swan</a>" possibilities that these polls missed critical aspects of reality in their data models. After all, I'm really interested in social science data from a "method and theory" perspective, and I'm very skeptical of easy "data = truth" claims. Nevertheless, pretty much everyone told me to relax.</p>

        <p>Why does Cassandra (you know, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra" target="_blank">Cassandra</a>, the "Henny Penny" of ancient Greek epic poetry) always have to be right about the worst of all outcomes?</p>

        <p>My worst fears are now coming true, and I'm learning to trust myself more. And here is how I see things:</p> 
        
        <ol>
          <li>The first thing to remember is to get yourself out of the habit of thinking that anything is <em>normal</em>, and that any norm, or law, or constitutional protection will be respected. The only pattern that applies to Trump is that he routinely and habitually breaks any and all norms and rules to please his own ego. Becoming President certainly won't stop that! Now he has free reign to rule as an authoritarian kleptocrat. People who <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20161108062911/https://thecorrespondent.com/5575/our-fate-was-sealed-long-before-november-8-and-not-because-the-elections-rigged/1576889402275-7591b019" target="_blank">study authoritarian regimes</a> or fled from authoritarian regimes say exactly this about Trump, and I trust their judgement far more than American's telling me to just relax. Afterall, Trump did promise to bring back torture, saying "<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/24/donald-trump-on-waterboarding-even-if-it-doesnt-work-they-deserve-it" target="_blank">even if doesn't work, they deserve it</a>". We have to <a href="http://www2.nybooks.com/daily/s3/nov/10/trump-election-autocracy-rules-for-survival.html" target="_blank">listen to what the autocrat says</a>, not what we want to hear.</li>

          <li>Essentially the Republic has already fallen, and we largely don't want to face that reality. "Authoritarian kleptocracy" probably captures the essence of our new reality. While it triumphed in November 2016, key pieces emerged much earlier. As author William Gibson remarked "the future is already here, it's just unevenly distributed". Decades long erosion of democratic processes manifested by mass-incarceration, vote supression, lobbying, propagandistic media, and the surveilance state all led to this moment. Whether or not Trump's specific regime will become entrenched to endure for decades (his sons are now in positions of power) or will fall apart quickly under its own incompetence, I don't know. I also don't expect a visit from the Gestapo on January 20, 2017, otherwise I wouldn't write this stuff. Again, the future is unevenly distributed, and there are many others (journalists, opposition politicians, and vulnerable minorities) who will feel increasing risks of reprisals first. Initially, we'll probably just see more and more self-organized fascist intimidation, but without even the motions of FBI or media to investigation to deter violence. After that, all bets are off.</li>

        <li>While this was long in coming, November 2016 truly marked a watershed. Now there is no going back to our old comfort zone about how democracy works in America. Instead of planning for winning some elections in 2018, we should fight to make sure we will even have free and fair elections in 2018. We can no longer trust those old certainties. We've already had too many betrays of trust. Trump himself obsessively talked about a "rigged election", the FBI actually threw the election with spurious accusations fed to a media that could not look beyond the emails to see fascism, business failures, corruption, Russian meddling, sexual assaults, and long list of policy absurdities. After all this, if we do vote in 2018 or 2020, how do we know it will actually count? Where are the institutional checks that can make such guarantee? How do we restore trust in the basics?</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>What do we do now?</h3>

        <p>I don't know specifics except that we should beware our own urge to climb back into our comfort zone and pretend it will all be OK. We can start with making his supporters uncomfortable by trying to make Trump the main object of their fears. The Trump supporters I know are not Neo-Nazis or KKK members. They just don't want to be made uncomfortable and do not want to face people and realities that they fear.</p>

        <p>The urge to deny uncomfortable truths is the hardest part of stopping Trump and eroding his support. There will be huge pressure to "normalize" Trump. Some of that will come from our own wishful thinking, hoping that he'll somehow moderate or be held in check by courts, Congress or the media. Some normalization will be also purposeful as media companies, universities, even many other self-interested institutions that seek some sort of accommodation. See the tweets by David Frum, former speech writer for President George W. Bush, about just what so many people and institutions will try to make seem normal:</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top:24px;">Frum's Tweet Storm</h4>
        <div style="margin-bottom: 48px;">
          <img class="img-responsive" src="https://archive.org/download/TrumpElectoralCol/Lets-have-a-fresh-start-best.png" />
        </div>
          
        <p>The absolute first priority will be to undermine Trump's normality and legitimacy and oppose him at every turn. Yes, he legally won more Electoral College delegates. But constitutionally, the Electoral College vote actually awards the Presidency, and the Electoral College <a href="https://medium.com/@lessig/on-faithless-but-democratically-faithful-electors-6fe22fb98b64#.npqe6d4vi" target="_blank">does not have to vote</a> in state-by-state "winner-take all" blocks. We need to fight to sway that vote.</p>
        
        <p>Neverthless, swaying the Electoral College, though constitutional, is very unlikely and it will probably vote Trump in as President. But there's more to legitimacy than constitutional processes. If we amended the Constitution to say the world was flat, it would still be wrong, even if enshrined in the Constitution. As Frum's list above illustrates, corruption and incitement of hate and violence against millions of people trumps any legitimacy offered by constitutional processes. We need to demonstrate to his supporters exactly how far Trump lies outside of anyone's comfort-zone. We need to make people truly uncomfortable and afraid that Trump just named an overt <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/14/steve-bannon-white-house-racism-fear" target="_blank">Neo-Nazi as a key White House adviser</a>.</p>

        <p>Moreover, we should listen, learn from, and follow the people in America who have put up with elements of authoritarianism for a long time. We have not all shared in the protections of American civil liberties. Native Americans, African Americans, and many, many other minorities of various kinds have much more experience in resisting a police state than most research data management experts. So, those of us who are novices to the police-state should should seek guidance and leadership from expert survivors.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, we need to voice a humane alternative to fascism. Neoliberalism, which has dominated world governance for decades, and for which (rightly or wrong) Hillary Clinton seemed to embody, has clearly collapsed. I would say good-riddance, except for my terror that (bad) neoliberalism will be replaced by something far darker. We need an emotionally resonant, pragmatic, and humane institutional order that makes human dignity and love (cheesy, but yes) central. Maybe it will come from the Occupy Movement, maybe elsewhere else. But from the perspective of this digital archaeologist, writing on the cusp of some sort of dictatorship, all our efforts to curate memories of our diverse pasts will come to nothing if we cannot sustain loving and nurturing civil socities.</p>     

        <h3>Cassandra or Fool?</h3>
        <p>Finally, I come to the title of this essay. Some people have said that I'm overreacting hysterically and should just get some sleep. After all, remember all those people who bought guns because they thought the Obama Presidency equaled a dictatorship? So maybe I'm just a sore loser who will look back at my rants from November 2016 with embarrassment.</p>

        <p>So let me just state now, for the record, I would love to look like a fool over my worries about dictatorship. Egg on my face would be the happiest possible outcome. Please do everything you can to make me a fool. I played Cassandra once in this whole thing, and I'd much rather play a fool.</p>
