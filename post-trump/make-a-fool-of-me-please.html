        <p>This represents a first attempt to make sense of what is happening, from the perspective of a digital archaeologist and open access advocate. Beware! It is my first pass at trying to come to grips with a new reality. It will be somewhat rambling as I haven’t fully integrated my thoughts into anything close to coherence.</p>

        <p>Donald J. Trump is now President-Elect, even though he lost the popular vote. Just to remind everyone, in 2012 when Trump thought that Romney won the popular vote, but lost the electoral college he used Twitter to call for a <a href="https://theintercept.com/2016/11/10/trump-warms-electoral-college-4-years-calling-disaster-democracy/" target="_blank">"revolution" against Obama</a>.</p>

        <h5>And finally, Trump tweeted little nugget of Truth</h5>:
        <img class="img-responsive" src="https://archive.org/download/TrumpElectoralCol/Trump-electoral-college.png" />
        <p class="small">The truth hurts doesn't it?</p>

        <p>He deleted those <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13596932/trump-protestors-electoral-college-tweets" target="_blank">now awkward revolutionary tweets</a>. So you can’t see them for yourself, and you have to trust 3rd parties that archived the tweets. I suspect this kind of thing is now going to be the norm.</p>

        <p>Erasing digital history is a big-deal for those of us who want to safeguard our society’s digital and cultural memory. We already found it very hard in a society largely indifferent to our work. Now we have to do it in a situation fast becoming overtly hostile. I’ll get to some of those implications later, especially all the institutional failures that got us here, but first I want to talk about the immediate emergency.</p>

        <h3>Comforting Fascism</h3>
        <p>There's no getting away from this. There's been some talk of how "coastal elites" need to better understand the people and problems of "fly-over" country. I'm sure that's the case, as a humanist / social scientist I'm in the business of "better understanding" after all. We have friends, family, and colleagues in fly-over country and our work often takes us all over the US. We have some friends and family that have gone through cycles of unemployment and we also have some friends and family in fly-over country that enjoy higher standards of living, with much bigger homes, boats, vacation time, etc. While we all have stresses, in my small social network of "Red America", I rarely see the kinds of working hours, the stresses and precarity of uncertain and cut-throat grant funding, and relentless performance pressures that we routinely face working at the margins of a broken academic system. And yet, many of them voted for Trump, even though I bet my personal economic anxiety matches or exceeds theirs. So why?</p>

        <p>Most people, including my loved ones who voted for Trump, like their comfort zone. They are not evil, they do not want to hurt anyone, they just don't want their comfort zone disrupted. Sadly, that desire to maintain their comfort zone, and go about their lives includes a large dose of willful denial of reality. It is hard to see and grasp structural racism or police brutality. It's a lot easier to dismiss these issues as "whining". It is hard to acknowledge the reality of climate change and the hard questions it raises about so much of the world order. Similarly, "Hollywood" and "the Liberal Media" which all occasionally manage to raise questions about gender, race and other issues can be resented for intruding into the comfort zone. And finally, there is immigration. Immigration threatens one's comfort zone, since it brings one face to face with difference and the unknown.</p>

        <p>In the research community, we also try not to break our comfort zones. We can also lack much self-awareness of our own ethical blind-spots. As I've argued for years, many academic institutions, typically associated with the Left, can be <a href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2014/01/27/its-the-neoliberalism-stupid-kansa/" target="_blank">terribly dehumanizing and exploitative</a>. But a worse sin is insularity. We tend to talk among ourselves (our comfort zone), often avoiding confrontation, even concerns central to our work. You know those awkward moments with family when topics like religion and politics come up? Well in the interest of being polite and not wanting to cause offense, I personally largely kept my mouth shut and talked about food and weather (but not climate, because you know, <em>touchy</em>). Don't we share just a little complicit in the rise of White Nationalism (aka Nazism) that is now taking control of the US Republic?</p>

        <h3>Now What?</h3>
        <p>I invested my heart and soul in this past election, first supporting Bernie Sanders out of great enthusiasm (and money), and then Hillary Clinton out of great fear (and more money). I really, really tried because I was so worried about waking up exactly where we are now. Anyone who followed me on Twitter will remember my periodic panic attacks starting in July 2016 when I realized Trump could win. They will also remember my worries about the polls and the "Black Swan" possibilities that these polls missed critical aspects of reality in their data models. After all, I’m really interested in social science data from a "method and theory" perspective, and I'm very skeptical of "data = truth" claims. Nevertheless, pretty much everyone told me to relax.</p>

        <p>Why does Cassandra (you know, this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra" target="_blank">Cassandra</a>) always have to be right about the worst of all outcomes?</p>

        <p>My worst fears are now coming true, and I’m learning to trust myself more. The first thing to remember is to get yourself out of the habit of thinking that anything is normal, and that any norm, or law, or constitutional protection will be respected. The only pattern that applies to Trump is that he routinely and habitually breaks any and all norms and rules to please his own ego. Becoming President certainly won't stop that! Now he has free reign to rule as a dictator.</p>

        <p>Essentially the Republic has already fallen, and we largely don't want to face that reality. The word "dictatorship" is not very specific, and covers a vast range of different kinds and different degrees of awful (think Pol Pot, Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Hussein, Putin, Erdogan, Pinochet, etc, etc). Whether or not this will become entrenched to endure for decades (his sons are now in positions of power) or will fall apart quickly under its own incompetence, I don't know. I also don't expect a visit from the Gestapo on January 20, 2017, otherwise I wouldn't write this stuff. Initially, we'll probably just see more and more self-organized "alt-right" intimidation, but without an FBI or media to investigate or deter such intimidation. After that, all bets are off.</p>

        <h3>So how do we stop Trump?</h3>

        <p>I don’t know. Instead of planning for winning some elections in 2018, we should be more worried if we will even have free and fair elections in 2018. We can no longer trust those old certainties. We've already had too many betrays of trust from Trump himself talking about a "rigged election", to the FBI that actually threw the election, to the media that could not look beyond the emails to see fascism, corruption, sexual assaults, and long list of policy absurdities.</p>

        <h3>OK, what do we do now?</h3>

        <p>Again, I don't know. We can start with making his supporters uncomfortable by trying to make Trump the main object of their fears. As I wrote above, the Trump supporters I know are not Neo-Nazis or KKK members. They just don't want to be made uncomfortable and do not want to face people and realities that they fear.</p>

        <p>The urge to deny uncomfortable truths is the hardest part of stopping Trump and eroding his support. There will be huge pressure to "normalize" Trump. Some of that will come from our own wishful thinking, hoping that he’ll somehow moderate or be held in check by courts, Congress or the media. Some normalization will be also purposeful as media companies, universities, even many other self-interested institutions that seek some sort of accommodation. See the tweets by David Frum, former speech writer for President George W. Bush, about just what so many people and institutions will try to make seem normal:</p>

        <h5>Frum's Tweet storm</h5>
        <img class="img-responsive" src="https://archive.org/download/TrumpElectoralCol/Lets-have-a-fresh-start-best.png" />

        <p>The absolute first priority will be to undermine Trumps normality and legitimacy. There's plenty of material to discredit him (see Frum's list above). We need to demonstrate to his supporters exactly how far Trump lies outside of anyone's comfort-zone. We need to make people truly uncomfortable and afraid that Trump just named an overt Neo-Nazi as his main and most trusted adviser.</p>

        <p>Moreover, we should listen, learn from, and follow the people in America who have put up with elements of "dictatorship" for a long time. We have not all shared in the protections of American civil liberties. Native Americans, African Americans, and many, many other minorities of various kinds have much more experience in resisting a police state than most research data management experts. So, it is to them that police-state novices should seek guidance and leadership.</p>
        
        <p>Finally, we need to voice a humane alternative to fascism. Neoliberalism, which has dominated world governance for decades, and for which (rightly or wrong) Hillary Clinton seemed to embody, has clearly collapsed. I would say good-riddance, except for my terror neoliberalism will be replaced by something far darker. We need a new and humane institutional order that makes human dignity and love (cheesy, but yes) central. Maybe it will come from the Occupy Movement, maybe elsewhere. But from the perspective of this digital archaeologist, writing on the cusp of fascist dictatorship, all our efforts to curate memories of our pasts will come to nothing if we cannot make loving and nurturing civil socities.</p>     

        <h5>Cassandra or Fool?</h5>
        <p>Finally, I come to the title of this blog post. Some people have said that I'm overreacting hysterically and should just get some sleep. After all, remember all those people who bought guns because Obama Presidency equaled a dictatorship? So maybe I'm just a sore loser who will look back at my rants from November 2016 with embarrassment.</p>

        <p>So let me just state now, for the record, I would love to look like a fool over my worries about dictatorship. Egg on my face would be the happiest possible outcome. Please do everything you can to make me a fool. I played Cassandra once in this whole thing, and I'd much rather play a fool.</p>
